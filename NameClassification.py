# # Introduction
# In this problem,We have to train a model to identify unique patients in the sample dataset
# given.We are given with a csv file which contains Name,gender,DOB and fatherâ€™s name.As data
# can come from various sources,there is great possiblity of data redundancy.So we have to train
# our model to remove that redundancy by checking out those datas which are similar and be-
# longs to same person.So for solving this problem,I have used PYTHON and used packages like
# numpy,pandas and sklearn.

# # Data Preprocessing:
# So,as given data is in very raw form,for applying algorithm,we have to convert it into suitable
# form.So here we are reading the data from given csv file -train.csv which is present in data sub-
# folderAs we have to convert data into suitable datatype,we are counting the number of letters
# 1in fathers name (fn) and then will be sorting the data in descending order of name.(fn).To make
# cluster of people with simillar fathers name,we will assign a lable to fn_len,and we will change
# them for people with different fathers name.To differentiate people with different first names,we
# will do same thing on (ln) and get (ln_lable). To convert gender into suitable datatype,we will be
# assigning 0 to male and 1 to female. To convert DOB into suitbale datatype,we will be using unix
# date format that has unique integer assigned to every day in any year.

# # Learning Algorithm:
# Here in this problem,I will be using K means clustering algo.Initially we will be forming n number
# of clusters which are equal to number of different elements in training set -train.csv.We will give
# training points to fit() function and will make groups using predict() function.55 (printed o/p)is
# number of different final clusters remained after deduplication.After sorting,we will drop the rows
# having duplicate values and will only take one value per cluster in our final type.csv file.
