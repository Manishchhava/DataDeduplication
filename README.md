# DataDuplication
In this problem,We have to train a model to identify unique patients in the sample dataset given. It is very important to remove data redundancies from data as carrying extra data will increse both space and time complexity of programs.As data of person can come by various sources,it is quiet possible that we can get data of same person with minimal difference in first name.
