# Introduction 
In this problem,We have to train a model to identify unique patients in the sample dataset given.
It is very important to remove data redundancies from data as carrying extra data will increse both space and time complexity of programs.As data of person can come by various sources,it is quiet possible that we can get data of same person with minimal difference in first name.

## Programming Language
```PYTHON```

## Libraries used
* numpy
* sklearn
* pandas

## How to run code :
1. Clone this complete project
2. Unzip and nevigate to project folder
3. Run ```NameClassification.py``` using any pyhton environment
**An output file named as type.csv will be generated.**

#### Alternative using ```jupyter notebook```
Open ```NameClassification.ipynb``` and execute complete cells

**NB.pdf file will describe different parts of code.
**NB.ppt file will describe approch for the solution and algorithm used.
